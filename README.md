# terraform-config-inspect

This repository contains a helper library for extracting high-level metadata
about Terraform modules from their source code. It processes only a subset
of the information Terraform itself would process, and in return it's able
to be broadly compatible with modules written for many different versions of
Terraform.

```
$ go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-config-inspect@latest
```

```go
import "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-config-inspect/tfconfig"

// ...

module, diags := tfconfig.LoadModule(dir)

// ...
```

Due to the [Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html),
this library should be able to parse Terraform configurations written in
the language as defined with Terraform v1.0, although it may not immediately
expose _new_ additions to the language added during the v1.x series.

This library can also interpret valid Terraform configurations targeting
Terraform v0.10 through v0.15, although the level of detail returned may
be lower in older language versions.

## Command Line Tool

The primary way to use this repository is as a Go library, but as a convenience
it also contains a CLI tool called `terraform-config-inspect`, installed
automatically by the `go install` command above, that allows viewing module
information in either a Markdown-like format or in JSON format.
You need to explicitly add `$GOBIN` to your `PATH` to run this CLI without
qualifying the full path.

```sh
$ terraform-config-inspect path/to/module
```

```markdown
# Module `path/to/module`

Provider Requirements:

- **null:** (any version)

## Input Variables

- `a` (default `"a default"`)
- `b` (required): The b variable

## Output Values

- `a`
- `b`: I am B

## Managed Resources

- `null_resource.a` from `null`
- `null_resource.b` from `null`
```

```sh
$ terraform-config-inspect --json path/to/module
```

```json

## Contributing

This library and tool are intentionally focused on only extracting simple
top-level metadata about a single Terraform module. This is to reduce the
maintenance burden of keeping this codebase synchronized with changes to
Terraform itself: the features extracted by this package are unlikely to change
significantly in future versions.

For that reason, **we cannot accept external PRs for this codebase that add support for additional Terraform language features**.

Furthermore, we consider this package feature-complete; if there is a feature
you wish to see added, please open a GitHub issue first so we can discuss the
feasability and design before submitting a pull request. We are unlikely to
accept PRs that add features without discussion first.

We would be happy to review PRs to fix bugs in existing functionality or to
improve the usability of the Go package API, however. We will be hesitant about
any breaking changes to the API, since this library is used by a number of
existing tools and systems.

To work on this codebase you will need a recent version of Go installed. Please
ensure all files match the formatting rules applied by `go fmt` and that all
unit tests are passing.
